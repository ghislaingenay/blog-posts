## What is useState in React?

useState is a React hook that allows you to store and manage a piece of information (called "state") in functional components efficiently.
It enables developers to store stateful values, such as variables, and re-render the component when those values change.

This hook can be directly imported from the React library and used in any functional component.

<ClipboardCode>```js import {useState} from "react"; ```</ClipboardCode>

### Step 1. To start using "useState," you need to tell React what you want to store which information. For example, if you want to keep track of a number, you can set it up like this:

```jsx
const [number, setNumber] = useState(5);
```

Now that you have your number stored with the defaukt value of 5, you can read this **"number"** value by simply using the **"number"** variable

```jsx
console.log(number); // This will give you 5
```

You can also update the value of "number" by using the **"setNumber"** function

```jsx
setNumber(10);
```

By doing this, you are telling React to update the value of "number" to 10. React will then re-render the component and display the new value of "number" on the screen.
If you decide to log the value once again, you will see that it has been updated to 10.

```jsx
console.log(number); // This will give you 10
```

## Counter example

Let's take a look at a more practical example. We will create a simple counter that will increment or decrement by 1 or 5 every time we click on a button.
You have the possibility to reset the counter to 0 by clicking on another button.

<CounterState />

Now let's see how we can implement this counter system see above with code.
Each step will add a new piece of code and explain what it does.

~~Disclamer: The styling wasn not implmented in the example below~~

#### Step 1. Create a functional component called Counter

```jsx
// import useState to manage states
import { useState } from "react";


// This is the functional component
export const Counter = () => {

  // Initialize the state with a default value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Show UI with the different buttons
  return (
     <div>
      <div>
        <button>- 5</button>
        <button>- 1</button>
        {*/ Display the piece of information from count */}
        <p>{count}</p>
        <button>+ 1</button>
        <button>+ 5</button>
      </div>
      <button>RESET</button>
    </div>
  )
};
```

<ins>Main key points</ins>- This counter component contains a state called
"count" and a function called "setCount" that will allow us to update the value
of "count". - The "count" state is initialized with a default value of 0. - The
"count" state is displayed on the screen inside the paragraph tag <code>
  <p>{count}</p>
</code> by using the **"count"** variable.

#### Step 2. Add the logic to increment or decrement the count state

For this step, we will need to add a onClick event on the buttons in order to interact with the counter by using **"setCount"**.

<em>For example</em>
```jsx
<button onClick={() => setCount(() => count + 1)}>+1</button>; ```

Here we are telling React to update the value of "count" by adding 1 to the current value of "count" every time we click on the button.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button  onClick={() => setCount(() => count - 5)}>- 5</button>
        <button  onClick={() => setCount(() => count - 1)}>- 1</button>
        {*/ Display the piece of information from count */}
        <p>{count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(() => count + 1)}>+ 1</button>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(() => count + 5)}>+ 5</button>
      </div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>RESET</button>
    </div>
  )
};
```

Now, each time a button is clicked, the value of "count" will be updated and displayed on the screen according to the outcome of the onClick event function.

Now you know exactly, how to use useState in React. Now, let's try to change the code to avoid repeating ourselves (DRY principle).

  development

#### Step 3. DRY principle in Counter example

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const addValueToCount = (value: number) => setCount(() => count + value);
  const reinitializeCount = () => setCount(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button  onClick={() => addValueToCount(-5)}>- 5</button>
        <button  onClick={() => addValueToCount(-1)}>- 1</button>
        {*/ Display the piece of information from count */}
        <p>{count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => addValueToCount(1)}>+ 1</button>
        <button onClick={() => addValueToCount(5)}>+ 5</button>
      </div>
      <button onClick={reinitializeCount}>RESET</button>
    </div>
  )
};
```
