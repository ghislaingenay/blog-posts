## What is useState in React?

useState is a React hook that allows you to store and manage a piece of information (called "state") in functional components efficiently.
It enables developers to store stateful values, such as variables, and re-render the component when those values change.

This hook can be directly imported from the React library and used in any functional component.

<ClipboardCode>```js import {useState} from "react"; ```</ClipboardCode>

##### To start using "useState," you need to tell React what you want to store which information. For example, if you want to keep track of a number, you can set it up like this:

```jsx
const [number, setNumber] = useState(5);
```

Now that you have your number stored with the defaukt value of 5, you can read this **"number"** value by simply using the **"number"** variable

```jsx
console.log(number); // This will give you 5
```

You can also update the value of "number" by using the **"setNumber"** function

```jsx
setNumber(10);
```

By doing this, you are telling React to update the value of "number" to 10. React will then re-render the component and display the new value of "number" on the screen.
If you decide to log the value once again, you will see that it has been updated to 10.

```jsx
console.log(number); // This will give you 10
```
